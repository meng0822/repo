- This call is devoted to the advancement of the understanding of the entire spectrum of policy and control issues and their interactions to economic phenomena following exit from the Covid-19 crisis and from the European Union. The uncertainty over the nature of final agreements on trade will tend to lead to firms delaying investment and itâ€™s very hard for regions to regain their internationally competitive advantage, once lost, as a result of the scarring from these events.  

- This conference will bring together researchers from different research communities for an interdisciplinary stocktaking of the state of the art of research on the consequences of Brexit - and on the implications of the British withdrawal from the EU and devastating consequences on European integration. 

- The organisers invite submissions from scholars working on policy and practical issues and from those having a more theoretical or normative angle. Two special issues of high quality journals will serve as a legacy to record the unprecedented events that we are facing in the field of Finance; the *European Journal of Finance* and *Economic Modelling* have contributed special issues and welcome your submissions.
